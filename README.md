# Geeks Profile

In this repo, I collected the [base code](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/profile-application-using-python-flask-and-mysql/) from geeks for geeks. It is a simple web application that allows users to create their own profile. It uses [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) and [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/).

The main objective is to:

1. Run the app on a linux server.
2. Dockerize the app.
3. Create a Jenkins pipeline to build and push the docker images to Docker Hub.
4. Run the app with Kubernetes over Minikube.
